# Crypto Script
A Python script I wrote to track arbitrage opportunity for a few crypto currency exchanges. More of a programming exercise in using REST APIs during a time where the crypto currency craze was happening.

Application architecture is a python script that needs to be run continuously to update .txt files containing arbitrage calculations about a few crypto currencies on Liqui and Bittrix exchanges. Also made an excel spreadsheet that constantly reads in the output text file (via VBA Macro) to constantly display the results.

This implementation is not feasible at all. More just an exercise for me.
